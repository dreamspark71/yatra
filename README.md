**Yatra** is a web app for tourists and travellers that assists in creating and sharing travel plans as well as searching for one that best fits their interests. The application attempts to help the user in three ways:
* Creating and sharing plans

  A travel plan consists of following information:
  * **Title** and **description**
  * **Route** consisting of points throughout the map where each point is associated with a day and has a description
  * **Access** describing whether this is available publicly or not
  Such plan can be created easily by clicking on map and adding rest of the information. A link to the plan is provided to be shared with others. Furthermore, public plans can be rated and reviewed by any user.

* Finding relevant plans

  Public travel plans developed by various users can be looked up to match oneâ€™s interests. Such interest may cover destination, budget, schedule and category.
* Recommending the best plans

  Recommendation system has been developed using both content-based and collaborative-approach with statistical approach of measuring similarities and scoring various plans. The user is thus provided with the plans that they might be most interest in based on their past activities (ratings).
